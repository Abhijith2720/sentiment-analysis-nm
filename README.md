# Decoding Emotions Through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversations

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on decoding human emotions expressed in social media conversations using NLP and Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing real-world posts from platforms like Twitter, we aim to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality to provide meaningful insights for researchers, brands, and mental health awareness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how people express emotions in online conversations.
- Collect and preprocess real or demo datasets.
- Train machine learning models to classify emotions automatically.
- Visualize emotional trends using graphs and word clouds.
- Explore real-world use cases like sentiment monitoring and opinion mining.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLP (NLTK, Scikit-learn)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Student Performance Dataset *(used for demo/testing ML pipeline)*
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)
- **Records:** 395 students
- **Features:** 33 features including demographics, academics, and behavior
- **Target:** G3 (Final Grade - numeric)
- *Note: Social media dataset will be used separately via Twitter API.*

## 🔁 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Gather tweets or use the UCI dataset as base input.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean text (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.).
3. **Feature Extraction** – Use TF-IDF or word embeddings.
4. **Model Training** – Train ML model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
5. **Emotion Classification** – Predict emotional labels.
6. **Visualization** – Show sentiment trends using charts/graphs.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open and run `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
